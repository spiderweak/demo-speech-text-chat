# DÃ©mo Speech Text Chat

This project is a Flask web application that captures audio from the user's microphone and uses OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text transcription.

## Features

- Record audio directly in the web browser.
- Send the audio data to a Flask server.
- Use Whisper to transcribe the audio to text.
- Display the transcription result on the web page.

# Todo

- Implement actual chatbot
- Various feedback loops to improve the quality of the transcript as well as the questions/answers
- More logging, especially to add conversation to contexts in case further processing is needed
- Real Time Transcription
